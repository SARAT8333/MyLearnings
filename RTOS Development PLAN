RTOS Learning

CHAPTER-1 :INTRODUCTION AND INTERNALS
          -Introduction to Real-Time Systems
          -Classification of real time systems
          -Difference between GPOS and RTOS
          -Real Time Kernels - RTOS Architecture
          -Features of RTOS POSIX-RT standard

CHAPTER-2 : PERFORMANCE METRICS AND SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS
          -Performance Metrics of RTOS-
          -Task Specifications-Task state 
          - Real Time Scheduling algorithms: Cyclic executive, Rate monotonic, IRIS and Least laxity scheduling
          -Schedulability Analysis
LAB1: Based on threads, signals

CHAPTER-3 : RESOURCE SHARING FOR REAL TIME TASKS
           - Resource sharing among tasks
           - Priority inversion Problem 
           - Priority inheritance and Priority ceiling Protocols 
           â€“ Features of commercial and open source real time operating systems: Vxworks, QNX, Micrium OS, RT Linux and Free RTOS

CHAPTER-4 :APPLICATION PROGRAMMING USING RTOS
           - Task synchronization using semaphores, Inter task communication: message queues and pipes, Remote procedure call
           - Timers and Interrupts
           - Memory management and I/O management
LAB2: Mutex, Semaphore, Messages and pipes

CHAPTER-4 : RTOS IMAGE BUILDING FOR DIFFERENT TARGET PLATFORMS
           - Porting of RTOS, Configuring RTOS for minimizing RAM consumption and increasing Throughput
           - Building RTOS Image for Target platforms

Lab3: Create software timers and calculate first expiry time, Go to Sleep mode (Deep sleep/light sleep) woke up and execute task, again go to sleep.
